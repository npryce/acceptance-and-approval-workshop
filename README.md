Accepting the Unexpectable
==========================

Copyright (c) 2013, Nat Pryce

Overview
--------

A half-day, hands-on programming workshop exploring how Specification by Example (aka Acceptance Test Driven Development, BDD) can work with numerical and exploratory programming, when:

 * acceptance is qualitative rather than precise, and/or…
 * the behaviour you want to capture involves a lot of numerical data, and/or…
 * you want to transition the results of exploratory programming to production.


Audience
--------

 * Developers and testers
 * Experienced with Specification by Example / Acceptance Test Driven Development / BDD
 * Can program some Java (not very much Java knowledge required)

Audience Requirements
---------------------

 * Laptop (one per pair)
 * Programming language and development environment of choice (as long as you can find a pair to work with)

Room Requirements
-----------------

 * Cafe-style room layout, allowing two or more pairs to work per table.
 * Enough power sockets for every pair to plug their laptop in.
 * Projector.
 * Flip-chart and marker pens.

|             | - Write an approval test for parsing an timeseries dataset         |
|             | - Implement a simple projection of the dataset into the future     |
|             | - Add a visualisation of the projection to the approval test       |
|             | - Iterate, improving the projection and/or apply to other datasets |
| 2:30 - 3:00 | Discussion and wrap-up                                             |
